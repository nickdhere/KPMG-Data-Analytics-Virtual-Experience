# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship Project

## Introduction
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship offers a unique opportunity to gain practical insights into the operations of KPMG while honing essential career skills and acquiring valuable experience.

**Client**: Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized organization specializing in bicycles and cycling accessories, has engaged Tony Smith, a Partner in KPMG's esteemed Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to leverage KPMG's expertise in Analytics, Information, & Modeling. This project is structured into three key tasks:

### Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
*Objective*: Evaluate data quality and completeness to prepare for in-depth analysis.

The client has provided KPMG with three vital datasets:
1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data from the past 3 months

We conducted an initial data exploration to identify opportunities for enhancing the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's data.

### Task 2: Data Insights
*Objective*: Identify high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

To achieve this, we initiated the project with a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation outlining our approach. The client has approved a three-week project scope, organized into three phases:
- Data Exploration
- Model Development
- Interpretation

We meticulously designed an approach that covers various activities, such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and comprehensive reporting.

### Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
*Objective*: Utilize visualizations to present key insights.

We developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau, showcasing a summary of the data and the results of our analysis. During our presentation of findings, we focused on addressing critical business questions, including:

- Analyzing trends within the underlying data
- Identifying the customer segment with the highest customer value
- Proposing marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd
- Exploring the potential of additional external datasets to gain deeper insights into customer preferences and purchase behavior
